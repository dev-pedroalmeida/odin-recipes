            dish to bring to a potluck. It freezes well. It reheats well.

        </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds medium Yukon Gold potatoes (6 to 7 potatoes), each cut lengthwise into eight (3/4- to 1-inch)
                wedges</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest, plus 1/4 cup fresh juice (from 2 lemons), divided</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>2 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>5 medium garlic cloves, grated using a Microplane grater</li>
            <li>4 (9-oz.) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, excess skin and fat trimmed</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
            <li>Lemon wedges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with 2 sheets of aluminum foil, pressing foil
                into
                corners and up sides of sheet. In a bowl, toss potatoes with lemon juice, oregano, and 2 tablespoons of
                the
                oil. Arrange potatoes, cut-side down in an even layer in the center of prepared baking sheet; sprinkle
                with
                1/2 teaspoon of the salt.</li>
            <li>Stir together lemon zest, garlic, and remaining 1 tablespoon oil in a small bowl until combined. Rub
                mixture
                all over chicken. Season chicken evenly with pepper and 1 1/2 teaspoons of the salt. Place 1 chicken
                thigh,
                skin-side up, in each corner of prepared baking sheet, moving potatoes as needed to allow chicken to lie
                flat on baking sheet. Roast in preheated oven until chicken skin is golden and a thermometer inserted
                into
                thickest portion of meat registers at least 165°F, 35 to 40 minutes, rotating baking sheet front to back
                and
                flipping potatoes halfway through cook time.</li>
            <li>Remove baking sheet from oven. Transfer chicken to a plate; cover with foil to keep warm. Using a
                spatula,
                gently toss potatoes with drippings on baking sheet; spread potatoes in an even layer. Return baking
                sheet
                to oven, and roast until potatoes are browned in spots, 10 to 15 minutes. Gently toss potatoes (still on
                baking sheet) with dill, fresh oregano, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Transfer potatoes and chicken
                to a
                serving platter, and serve with lemon wedges.</li>
