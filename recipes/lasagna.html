    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Olive oil, for coating baking dish</li>
        <li>9 to 12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</li>
        <li>Zest of 1 fresh lemon</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher or sea salt, or to taste</li>
        <li>Fresh cracked black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>24 ounces tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups cooked chicken</li>
        <li>16 ounces (1 pound) grated mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375Â°. Lightly coat a 2-quart baking dish with olive oil and set aside.</li>
        <li>Cook lasagna noodles until al dente according to package instructions. Rinse under cold water until cool.
            Lay the cooked pasta flat and set aside.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the ricotta cheese, egg, Parmigiano-Reggiano, lemon zest, salt and pepper. Set
            aside.</li>
        <li>Layer one-third of the remaining tomato sauce over the lasagna noodles and then layer half of the ricotta
            mixture. Layer half of the chicken over the ricotta and then spread one-third of the mozzarella cheese.
            Repeat this pattern: noodles, sauce, ricotta cheese, chicken and mozzarella cheese. Add a final layer of
            lasagna noodles, then add remaining tomato sauce and remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake lasagna for about 45 minutes or until the top cheese is melted and golden.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven; allow to cool for about 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
